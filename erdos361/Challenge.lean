TRUSTED CHALLENGE FILE — the statements, without proofs.

This file is the audit surface. Comparator (github.com/leanprover/comparator) checks that
the corresponding declarations in `Solution.lean` prove EXACTLY these statements, using no
axioms beyond the permitted list in `comparator/*.json`:
  • `erdos361_cge1`      — [propext, Quot.sound, Classical.choice]  (axiom-free).
  • `erdos361_irregular` — [propext, Quot.sound, Classical.choice]  (axiom-free). Alon 1987
    Thm 1.1, formerly postulated, is now PROVED in `Erdos361/Core.lean` (general-h Dias da
    Silva–Hamidoune from Mathlib's Combinatorial Nullstellensatz, on the subsequence n = 2p).

The `sorry`s below are deliberate and are the only `sorry`s in the repository.

Import closure: `Erdos361.Statement` (definitions only) and Mathlib. Nothing
from the development is trusted here.

WHAT EACH STATEMENT SAYS, in words:

  erdos361_cge1      For 1 ≤ n ≤ M, the max cardinality of a subset of [1,M] with no subset
                     summing to n equals M − ⌈n/2⌉ (here `(n+1)/2` = ⌈n/2⌉ in ℕ). Hence for
                     c ≥ 1, f_c(n)/n → c − 1/2: the regular range.

  erdos361_irregular Erdős–Graham irregularity. For every real c ∈ (0,1) the sequence
                     f_c(n)/n = F ⌊cn⌋ n / n does NOT converge.

`E₀` such that for all `E ≥ E₀`, every `A ⊆ [1,E]` of density `≥ 1/3 + ε` represents every even

hypothesis: Freiman's `3k-3` theorem (`|B+B| ≥ min{L,2|B|-3}+|B|`), which earlier revisions carried as
the hypothesis `hFreiman`, is now **proved from scratch** in `Erdos361/BasileFreiman.lean`
(`Erdos361Freiman.freiman_3k3`, Nathanson's Kneser-free induction, no Mathlib port exists). Alon's
