TRUSTED STATEMENT LAYER — Erdős Problem #361.

Import closure: Mathlib only. Contains ONLY definitions — NO axioms. (Alon 1987 Thm 1.1,
formerly postulated here, is now PROVED axiom-free in `Erdos361/Core.lean` via general-h
Dias da Silva–Hamidoune from Mathlib's Combinatorial Nullstellensatz.) This file +
`Challenge.lean` are the entire audit surface: read them and you have read everything you
must trust.

The definitions are verbatim copies of the development's (`Erdos361/Core.lean`, namespace
`Erdos361`, which imports this file); `Solution.lean` proves each headline theorem by direct
term assignment, forcing Lean to check the two agree.
