# Erdős Problem 361 — irregularity of forbidden-subset-sum extremal sets

> For fixed `c > 0` let `f_c(n) = max { |A| : A ⊆ {1, …, ⌊cn⌋}, n ∉ Σ(A) }`, where `Σ(A)`
> is the set of nonempty subset sums. **Does `f_c(n)/n` converge?**
> **Answer: it converges iff `c ≥ 1`.** For `c ≥ 1`, `f_c(n) = ⌊cn⌋ − ⌈n/2⌉`, so
> `f_c(n)/n → c − 1/2`. For every `c ∈ (0,1)`, `f_c(n)/n` does **not** converge — the
> affirmative answer to the Erdős–Graham irregularity question.

## Results

| Paper result | Statement | Lean name | Module |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Regular range (`c ≥ 1`) | `F M n = M − ⌈n/2⌉` for `1 ≤ n ≤ M` | `Erdos361.Statement.erdos361_cge1` | `Erdos361/Core.lean` |
| **Theorem 4 (irregularity)** | `∀ c ∈ (0,1)`, `f_c(n)/n` has no limit | `Erdos361.Statement.erdos361_irregular` | `Erdos361/Core.lean` |

`f_c(n)` is modelled by `Fc c n = F ⌊c·n⌋ n`, where `F M n` is the max cardinality of an
avoider of `n` in `[1,M]` (`Erdos361/Statement.lean`).

## How the statements are kept honest

`Erdos361/Statement.lean` (definitions only, Mathlib-only import) and `Challenge.lean`
(the two statements, `sorry`) are the **entire audit surface**. `Solution.lean` proves the
same two statements by direct term assignment from the development, so Lean checks the
development's statements are definitionally the trusted ones.
[Comparator](https://github.com/leanprover/comparator) verifies this mechanically on CI
(`comparator/`), and checks the axiom footprints.

## Axiom-free

**Both** `erdos361_cge1` and `erdos361_irregular` are **axiom-free** — `[propext, Quot.sound,
Classical.choice]` only. The paper's sole external input, **Alon 1987** *(Subset Sums, J.
Number Theory 27 (1987) 196–205, Theorem 1.1)* — formerly postulated as an axiom — is now
**proved from scratch** in `Erdos361/Core.lean`: the general-`h` **Dias da Silva–Hamidoune**
restricted-sumset bound (built from Mathlib's Combinatorial Nullstellensatz) gives Alon's
theorem over a prime modulus, and the irregularity is assembled on the subsequence `n = 2p`
(`p` prime). See `VERIFICATION.md` §4.

## Verify it yourself

```bash
cd erdos361
lake exe cache get
lake build                 # the development (Erdos361)
lake build Challenge Solution
```

Comparator (Linux-only; runs on CI):
```bash
lake env /path/to/comparator comparator/erdos361_cge1.json        # expect: Your solution is okay!
lake env /path/to/comparator comparator/erdos361_irregular.json   # expect: Your solution is okay!
```
