STATEMENT MODULE — definitions only, no theorems, no proofs.

This file holds every project-specific definition the trusted statement in
`Challenge.lean` rests on. Together with Mathlib it is the entire audit surface: read
this file and `Challenge.lean` and you have read everything you must trust.

The definitions are byte-for-byte those of the certified development file
(`HRTLambda0/Endgame.lean` proves the theorems about them).

READ `ZakReduction` CAREFULLY — it is the honesty-critical definition. It packages, as a
single named HYPOTHESIS on the window `g`, everything the paper establishes before its
endgame (the Zak-transform reduction, the WLOG that all four coefficients are nonzero,
the fibre dichotomy producing a live interval, the degree identity at `j = 0`, and
Jensen's formula on the fibre). None of that is proved in this repository. The theorem
in `Challenge.lean` is CONDITIONAL on it, and that conditionality is the honest content
of this solution folder.
