# MathDB #333521 — the balanced complete bipartite graph minimises the distance signless
Laplacian spread

Foundations only in this file so far: the distance matrix, the transmission, the distance signless
Laplacian `Q = Tr + D`, and its spread.  **None of these exist in Mathlib** — there is no distance
matrix, no transmission, no Wiener index.  `SimpleGraph.dist` does exist, with `dist_comm` and a
usable API, and `SimpleGraph.IsBipartiteWith` exists too.

Three design decisions, each of which the rest of the row depends on.

**Connectedness is a hypothesis on the definitions' *lemmas*, not on the definitions.**
`G.dist u v = 0` when `u` and `v` are unreachable, so `D` is silently wrong on a disconnected
graph rather than undefined.  Making `Connected` a field of the matrix would force it through every
rewrite; carrying it as a hypothesis where it is used keeps the definitions computable and the
statements honest.

**The spectrum is taken through `Matrix.toEuclideanLin`, not through `Matrix.IsHermitian`.**
The matrix-level `eigenvalues` is indexed by the *vertex type* and carries no ordering, whereas the
spread needs the largest and the smallest.  `LinearMap.IsSymmetric.eigenvalues` is indexed by
`Fin n` and comes with `eigenvalues_antitone`, so `q₁` is `eigenvalues 0` and `qₙ` is
`eigenvalues (last)` by construction rather than by an extra sorting argument.  This also matches
`Common.HermitianRayleigh`, which is stated for symmetric linear maps.

**The spread is defined from the ordering, not as a `⨆ - ⨅`.**  Same reason as the Rayleigh
bounds: a caller comparing spreads wants two named endpoints, not two lattice operations whose
`Nonempty` side conditions have to be discharged at each use.

/-! ### The three distance sums, and the bound the source calls (1)

The source writes these over **unordered** pairs: `X = ∑_{{u,v}⊆A} d(u,v)`, with `X ≥ a(a-1)` from
`a(a-1)/2` pairs each at distance `≥ 2`.  Summing over `Finset.offDiag` gives the **ordered** sum
`= 2X`, and every constant then lands without a division.

Two deliberate choices.  The bounds are stated against `S.offDiag.card` rather than against
`S.card ^ 2 - S.card`, which keeps ℕ-subtraction and its casts out of the statement entirely —
`Finset.offDiag_card` relates the two for a caller who wants the closed form.  And the part
memberships are hypotheses (`∀ u ∈ S, u ∈ s`) rather than a bundled "S is the part", so the same
lemma serves both `A` and `B` without a symmetry argument. -/

even, connectedness forces it nonzero, and there is no even number strictly between.  This is the

/-! ### Evaluating at the all-ones vector — the source's inequality (3)

`q₁ ≥ 4W/n` is the one bound in the source needing no case analysis: the Rayleigh quotient at the
all-ones vector is `1ᵀQ1 / n`, and `1ᵀQ1` is twice the ordered distance sum, because the two halves
of `Q = Tr + D` contribute the same total — the diagonal by definition of transmission, the
distance matrix by being the same sum written out.

Stated **multiplied out**, `2·totalDist ≤ q₁ · n`, rather than as `4W/n ≤ q₁`.  There is then no
division and no `n ≠ 0` side condition, and the *ordered* sum `totalDist = 2W` absorbs the factor
the source carries as a `4`, so no constant is ever halved. -/

/-! ### Averaging over difference vectors — the source's inequality (4)

The source bounds `qₙ` by averaging Rayleigh quotients over an **orthonormal basis of the zero-sum
subspace** supported on one part.  **We never build that basis.**  `Common.mul_sum_norm_sq_le_sum_inner_apply`
requires no orthogonality and no normalisation, so the over-complete, wildly non-orthogonal family
of differences `eᵤ - eᵥ` — indexed by *all* ordered pairs from the part — serves just as well, and
it is explicit, so every quantity it needs is a finite sum rather than a construction.

**The two routes give literally the same bound — checked by hand and numerically, NOT by Lean.**
Over `S ×ˢ S` the difference family yields `qₙ · |S|(|S|-1) ≤ (|S|-1)·T_S − X_S`, and expanding the
source's `r_A = (2(a-2)X + (a-1)Z)/(a(a-1))` gives `2aX − 4X + (a−1)Z`, the same number.  The
elaborator sees only the left-hand side of that comparison: **the source's formula appears nowhere
in this development, so no theorem here can be evidence about it.**  What does support it is the
independent check recorded in the campaign README — evaluating the assembled `θ = 0` bound at the
parity minima reproduces `B₀ = 3n/2 + d/2 + d²/n` exactly, as a rational number, for every `(a,b)`
tested.  Treat this paragraph at that strength and no higher.

So nothing is lost by trading the orthonormal basis for the redundant family — the *bound* was never
using the orthogonality, only the count, which is why the hypothesis could be dropped upstream.

**Why the diagonal costs nothing.**  Summing over the full product rather than `offDiag` looks
wasteful, but `eᵤ - eᵤ = 0`, so the diagonal contributes `0` to both sides and needs no exclusion.
That is what removes `Finset.offDiag` from the argument entirely — and with it the counting lemma
`∑_{p ∈ S.offDiag} g p.1 = (|S|-1) ∑ g` that Mathlib does not have. -/

/-! ### Combining (3) and (4) into a spread bound — the source's step 3

The source writes `S_Q ≥ 4(X+Y+Z)/n − θ r_A − (1−θ) r_B`, three nested quotients.  Every one of
them is avoidable: a lower bound on `q₁` and an upper bound on `qₙ` combine into a lower bound on
`q₁ − qₙ` **by cross-multiplication**, provided the two denominators are positive — and they are,
being a vertex count and `2|S|(|S|−1)`.

`combine_bounds` is the whole content and it is pure arithmetic: from `a ≤ q₁c` and `qₙd ≤ b` with
`c, d > 0`, conclude `ad − bc ≤ (q₁ − qₙ)(cd)`.  It mentions no graph and could be promoted to
`Common/`; it is left here as a single lemma rather than made into a module of its own, which is a
judgement about file hygiene and not about its generality.

The `θ` step then needs no work at all, and that is worth saying plainly rather than hiding in a
proof.  `θ r_A + (1−θ) r_B` looks like an optimisation, but a **convex combination of two lower
bounds on the same quantity is again a lower bound**, so `spread_convex` is three lines.  All the
difficulty the source's `θ` carries is in *choosing* it to make the coefficients `c_X, c_Y, c_Z`
nonnegative — a case analysis, not an inequality — and that is the next stage, not this one. -/

/-- **Two one-sided bounds on a difference, combined without division.**  From `a ≤ q₁c` and
`qₙd ≤ b` with `c, d > 0`: `ad − bc ≤ (q₁ − qₙ)(cd)`.  This is `q₁ ≥ a/c` and `qₙ ≤ b/d` giving
`q₁ − qₙ ≥ a/c − b/d`, with both denominators cleared. -/

/-! ### Expanding the transmissions over a bipartition — where `X`, `Y`, `Z` finally appear

Everything above holds for an arbitrary vertex set `S`, because nothing in the Rayleigh argument
looked at the bipartition.  It enters exactly here, and only through one fact: the two parts
**cover** the vertex set, so a transmission splits as within-part plus across-part.

Note the covering hypothesis is carried explicitly rather than taken from `IsBipartiteWith`.
Mathlib's `IsBipartiteWith s t` deliberately does **not** require `s ∪ t = univ` — a convention
`Common/BipartiteDistance.lean` inherits rather than strengthens — so a formalisation that assumed
coverage from it would be assuming something false. -/

/-- **`T_A = X_A + Z`**: the transmission sum over a part is its within-part distance sum plus its
across-part sum.  The only input is that the parts cover the vertex set. -/

/-! ### The master inequality at `θ = 0`, with the coefficients named

Substituting both bipartition identities into `spread_bound_of_part` at `S = B` collects the whole
`θ = 0` bound into `c_X·X + c_Y·Y + c_Z·Z ≤ S_Q · (n · 2b(b−1))` with

  `c_X = 4b(b−1)`,  `c_Y = 4b(b−1) − 2n(b−2)`,  `c_Z = 2(b−1)(4b − n)`.

Naming the coefficients is the point of this stage.  Once they are named, the six regimes of the
source's case table stop being an analytic question and become a question about the **signs of
three real numbers** — and the parity bounds of inequality (1) may be substituted term by term the
moment a coefficient is known nonnegative.  `le_of_coeffs_nonneg` is that substitution, stated once
so no regime has to redo it.

**Checked against the source at the balanced even point.**  With `a = b = m` and `n = 2m` the
coefficients are `4m(m−1)`, `4m`, `4m(m−1)`; substituting `X ≥ 2m(m−1)`, `Y ≥ 2m(m−1)`, `Z ≥ m²`
and dividing by `n·2b(b−1) = 4m²(m−1)` gives `2(m−1) + 2 + m = 3m`, which is the source's
`B₀ = 3n/2`.  The arithmetic of this stage was verified against that value before it was written. -/

/-- **Monotone substitution.**  With all three coefficients nonnegative, any lower bounds on
`X, Y, Z` may be substituted into the master inequality.  Stated separately so that each regime of
the case table supplies only the three sign facts and reuses this. -/

/-! ### The general-`θ` master inequality

`θ = 0` used only the `B` part.  The two regimes the source still needs — `θ_Z` for `b ∈ {2,3}` and
`θ_Y` for `b ≥ 4` — need both parts weighted together, and the obvious route (`qₙ ≤ θ r_A +
(1−θ) r_B`) reintroduces the two denominators that step 3 was careful to clear.

They clear again, by the same trick and with no new idea: weight the `A` bound by `θ·Q` and the `B`
bound by `(1−θ)·P`, where `P = 2a(a−1)` and `Q = 2b(b−1)` are the two part weights.  The `qₙ`
coefficients then both become `P·Q`, the `θ` and `1−θ` sum to one, and what remains is
`qₙ·(P·Q) ≤ θ·Q·R_A + (1−θ)·P·R_B` — the convex combination, with every denominator already gone.

`spread_theta_zero` is the `θ = 0` case of what follows, kept because it is the regime that
discharges most of the table and its coefficients are the ones checked against `B₀`. -/

/-! ### The base bound: substituting the parity minima

With the coefficients named, each regime of the source's case table needs exactly three facts —
`0 ≤ c_X`, `0 ≤ c_Y`, `0 ≤ c_Z` — and `base_bound_le_spread` converts them into a lower bound on
the spread in `a` and `b` alone.  Nothing below is regime-specific; the case analysis supplies only
the three signs.

**Both remaining regimes were checked numerically against the source before this was written**,
in the ordered convention and as exact rationals: at `θ_Y = (a(b−2) − b²)/(n(b−2))` for `b ≥ 4` the
base bound equals the source's `B_Y = 3n/2 + d(bn − 2d)/(2n(b−2))`, and at
`θ_Z = a(a−3b)/(n(a−b))` for `b ∈ {2,3}` it equals `B_Z = 2n` exactly — in every case where
`θ ∈ [0,1]`, with all three coefficients nonnegative.  That check is arithmetic on our own
coefficients against a closed form appearing nowhere in this file, so **Lean does not see it**;
it is recorded here at that strength and no higher. -/

/-- `|S.offDiag| = |S|² − |S|` over `ℝ`.  Mathlib's `offDiag_card` is a **ℕ**-subtraction identity;

/-! ### The `θ = 0` regime, discharged

The first of the source's six rows, complete.  At `θ = 0` the three coefficients factor:

  `c_X = 2·P·Q`,  `c_Y = 2·P·(Q − n(b−2))`,  `c_Z = 2·P·(b−1)·(4b − n)`

with `P, Q ≥ 0`, so `c_X` is unconditional and the other two reduce to the two scalar conditions
`n(b−2) ≤ Q` and `n ≤ 4b`.  Those are the source's "choose `θ = 0` when both smaller-part
coefficients are already nonnegative", made explicit.

The factorisations are why this row is cheap: each coefficient is a product of things already known
nonnegative and one linear condition, so `nlinarith` closes each on a single hint rather than
searching. -/

/-! ### The coefficients, factored — and what `θ_Z` is actually for

Each coefficient is a product of a manifestly nonnegative part weight with a **single scalar
condition**:

  `c_X = 2Q·(P − nθ(a−2))`,  `c_Y = 2P·(Q − n(1−θ)(b−2))`,
  `c_Z = 4(a−1)(b−1)·(4ab − nθb − na(1−θ))`

Verified as exact identities on 400 random `(a, b, θ)` before being written.  With these, a regime's
three sign obligations are three scalar inequalities in `a`, `b`, `n`, `θ` — no part weights, no
spectral objects, nothing to unfold.

**And `c_Z`'s factor is what `θ_Z` is for.**  The source introduces `θ_Z = a(a−3b)/(n(a−b))` for
`b ∈ {2,3}` without saying why that value; substituting it makes `4ab − nθb − na(1−θ)` **exactly
zero** — checked for `b ∈ {2,3}` across `a`, always `0`, never merely nonnegative.  So that regime
does not need a `c_Z ≥ 0` inequality at all, it needs an **equation**, and
`base_bound_of_coeffZ_zero` consumes it directly.  An equation is much cheaper than an inequality
here, and it is the difference between substituting a quotient into three sign checks and
substituting it into one identity.

This is the third time on this row that a step presented as an estimate turned out to be an exact
identity or a free consequence — the `θ` convexity, the denominators, and now `θ_Z` itself. -/

/-! ### `θ_Y` annihilates `c_Y`, exactly as `θ_Z` annihilates `c_Z`

The source gives two opaque formulas, `θ_Y = (a(b−2) − b²)/(n(b−2))` for `b ≥ 4` and
`θ_Z = a(a−3b)/(n(a−b))` for `b ∈ {2,3}`, without saying where either comes from.  They are the
**roots of `c_Y = 0` and `c_Z = 0`**, and that is the whole content of the case table:

| regime | `θ` | what it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| both smaller-part coefficients already nonnegative | `0` | nothing needs annihilating |
| `b ∈ {2,3}` | `θ_Z` | zeroes `c_Z` |
| `b ≥ 4` | `θ_Y` | zeroes `c_Y` |

Checked before formalising: at `θ_Y`, `c_Y` is identically `0` — never merely nonnegative — for
every `(a,b)` with `b = 4..9`, `a = b..b+7` and `θ_Y ∈ [0,1]`, with `c_X, c_Z ≥ 0` throughout.  The
same held for `θ_Z` and `c_Z`.  **Those checks are arithmetic on our own coefficients and Lean does
not see them**; what Lean sees is that *if* the scalar factor vanishes then the coefficient does,
which is `coeffY_eq_zero_of` below, and that this suffices, which is
`base_bound_of_coeffY_zero`.

So each regime supplies one linear equation in `θ` and two sign checks — never three inequalities.
That is the sense in which the six-row case table was never six rows of analysis. -/

/-! ### The two `θ`s, constructed rather than quoted

The source supplies `θ_Y` and `θ_Z` as formulas with no derivation.  Here they are **solved for**,
from the scalar factors of `coeffY_factor` and `coeffZ_factor`, and the source's expressions are
recovered rather than assumed:

* `c_Z`'s factor `4ab − nθb − na(1−θ)` is linear in `θ` with coefficient `n(a−b)`, so it vanishes at
  `θ = a(n − 4b)/(n(a−b))`.  Since `n = a + b`, `n − 4b = a − 3b`, and that is the source's
  `θ_Z = a(a−3b)/(n(a−b))`.
* `c_Y`'s factor `Q − n(1−θ)(b−2)` vanishes at `1 − θ = Q/(n(b−2))`, i.e.
  `θ = (n(b−2) − Q)/(n(b−2))`; expanding `Q = 2b(b−1)` and `n = a+b` gives the source's
  `θ_Y = (a(b−2) − b²)/(n(b−2))`.

Both identifications were confirmed as exact rationals against the source's formulas before this was
written, and each `θ` was confirmed to annihilate its coefficient identically.  **Lean checks that
these definitions annihilate the coefficients; it does not check that they agree with the source's
expressions**, which appear nowhere in this development.

The side conditions are exactly the ones the source's regimes carry, and for the same reason: `θ_Z`
needs `a ≠ b` because the balanced case is where `c_Z`'s `θ`-coefficient degenerates (and there
`θ = 0` already works), and `θ_Y` needs `b ≠ 2` because at `b = 2` the factor `(b−2)` is identically
zero and `c_Y` is unconditionally positive. -/

/-! ### The `θ_Z` row, discharged

At `θ_Z` the vertex count cancels out of both `n·θ` and `n·(1−θ)`, leaving two quotients with the
same denominator `a − b`:

  `n·θ_Z = a(n − 4b)/(a − b)`,  `n·(1 − θ_Z) = b(3a − b)/(a − b)`

so both sign conditions clear to polynomials.  `c_X` needs only `a ≥ b ≥ 2` — the cleared form is
`a(a² + ab − 4b) ≥ 0`, and `a² + ab − 4b` is already nonnegative at `a = b ≥ 2`.  `c_Y` is the one
that constrains the regime: cleared, it is `(3a − b)(b − 2) ≤ 2(b − 1)(a − b)`, which holds for
`2 ≤ b ≤ 3` with `a ≥ 3b` and **fails for `b = 4`** — checked, `c_Y = −16` at `a = 12..15`.  That is
why the source restricts `θ_Z` to `b ∈ {2,3}`, and the restriction is now derived rather than
quoted.

The hypothesis `a ≥ 3b` is also exactly `0 ≤ θ_Z`: `θ_Z = a(a − 3b)/(n(a − b))`, whose numerator
changes sign at `a = 3b`.  So the regime's two conditions — `θ_Z ∈ [0,1]` and `c_Y ≥ 0` — are the
same inequality, which is the kind of coincidence that stops looking like one once the `θ` is solved
for rather than quoted. -/

/-! ### The `θ_Y` row — and the whole case table is one sign test

Define the **discriminant**

  `S = 2(b−1)(a−b) − (3a−b)(b−2)`, which expands to `S = a(4 − b) − b²`.

Then, after clearing denominators:

* the `c_Y ≥ 0` condition of the `θ_Z` row **is exactly** `S ≥ 0`;
* the `c_Z ≥ 0` condition of the `θ_Y` row **is exactly** `S ≤ 0`.

The same scalar, compared against zero in opposite directions.  Since one of `S ≥ 0`, `S ≤ 0`
always holds, **the two regimes are exhaustive with no gap between them** — and the source's split
into `b ∈ {2,3}` versus `b ≥ 4` is a *sufficient way of deciding that sign*, not the underlying
dichotomy.  For `b ≥ 4` the factor `4 − b` is `≤ 0`, so `S ≤ 0` needs no hypothesis on `a` at all,
which is why `θ_Y` serves that whole range; for `b ≤ 3` with `a ≥ 3b` the sign goes the other way.

That is the last structural claim the row had left, and it is what a six-row case table really is:
**one quadratic, one comparison, two constructions.**

`c_X ≥ 0` at `θ_Y` holds with no extra hypothesis beyond the regime's own: cleared, it is
`u(a−2) ≤ 2a(a−1)(b−2)` where `u = a(b−2) − b²` is the numerator of `θ_Y`, and it follows from
`u ≤ a(b−2)` together with `a − 2 ≤ 2(a−1)`. -/

/-! ### `S_Q ≥ 3n/2`, and the extremal case is visible in the algebra

Multiplied out, the `θ = 0` base bound is an **exact identity**:

  `2·(c_X X₀ + c_Y Y₀ + c_Z Z₀) = P·Q·(3n² + n·d + 2d²)`,  `d = a − b`

(checked on 500 random `(a,b)` before formalising; it holds for all of them, not only `a ≥ b`).
Subtracting `3n²·P·Q` leaves `P·Q·(n d + 2d²)`, which is nonnegative for `d ≥ 0` and **exactly zero
when `a = b`**.  So the balanced case is not merely where the bound happens to be tight — it is the
unique zero of the remainder, sitting in plain sight in the polynomial.

That gives the theorem for even order: **every connected bipartite graph meeting the `θ = 0`
conditions has `S_Q ≥ 3n/2`**, which is the balanced complete bipartite value.

*What this does not settle.*  For **odd** `n` the target is `(2n+1+√(n²+8))/2`, which is strictly
**larger** than `3n/2` — the base bound falls short, by a deficit computed to lie strictly inside
`(−1/n, 0)`.  That is the source's remark that "the base deficit is less than `1/n`, while a missing
cross edge contributes `2c_Z = 4(n−2)/(n(n−1)) > 1/n`", and it is genuinely separate work: the odd

/-! ### `S_Q ≥ 3n/2` in the other two regimes

The `θ = 0` row gave `3n ≤ 2 S_Q` under its own two scalar conditions.  The same bound holds in the
other two regimes, and in each the margin over `3n/2` is again an exact identity rather than an
estimate:

* at `θ_Z`:  `2·(c_X X₀ + c_Y Y₀) = 4n²·P·Q`, so the margin over `3n²PQ` is a clean `n²PQ`
  (the source's `B_Z = 2n` against `3n/2`);
* at `θ_Y`:  `2·(c_X X₀ + c_Z Z₀) − 3n²·P·Q = P·Q·d(bn − 2d)/(b − 2)` with `d = a − b`, and
  `bn − 2d > 0` for `b ≥ 4`, so the margin is nonnegative and vanishes exactly at `a = b`.

Both were verified as exact rationals before formalising.  Since the three regimes are exhaustive —
`S = a(4−b) − b²` is either `≥ 0` or `≤ 0` — **`S_Q ≥ 3n/2` now holds in every regime**, with no
regime-specific estimate anywhere: three identities and three sign checks. -/

/-! ### The complete bipartite graph: its spread, without an eigenbasis

For `K_{a,b}` the distance is `0`, `2` or `1` according as the endpoints are equal, in the same
part, or in different parts.  That is all the following needs — it is stated as a hypothesis on
`G.dist` rather than by constructing the graph, so nothing here depends on how `K_{a,b}` is built.

The quadratic form then has a closed form (verified on 300 random instances first):

  `⟪x, Qx⟫ = (2a−4+b)·Σ_A + (2b−4+a)·Σ_B + 2S_A² + 2S_B² + 2S_A S_B`

with `S_A = ∑_A x`, `Σ_A = ∑_A x²`.  At `a = b = m` this collapses to
`(3m−4)‖x‖² + 2(S_A² + S_B² + S_A S_B)`, and **both extreme eigenvalues follow from that single
identity by elementary algebra** — no eigenspaces, no residual `2 × 2` block:

* `S_A² + S_B² + S_A S_B = (S_A + S_B/2)² + ¾S_B² ≥ 0`, so `qₙ ≥ 3m−4`;
* Cauchy–Schwarz gives `S_A² ≤ mΣ_A`, `S_B² ≤ mΣ_B` and `2S_AS_B ≤ S_A²+S_B²`, so the bracket is at
  most `(3m/2)‖x‖²` and `q₁ ≤ 6m−4`.

Hence `S_Q(K_{m,m}) ≤ 3m = 3n/2`, which with the lower bound proved for every bipartite graph makes
the balanced complete bipartite graph a minimiser for even order. -/

/-! ### The even-order theorem

Both halves are in hand, so they compose.  `K` is any graph on `V` whose distance function is that
of a **balanced** complete bipartite graph; `G` is any connected bipartite graph on the same vertex
set meeting the `θ = 0` regime conditions.  Then `S_Q(K) ≤ S_Q(G)`.

The two graphs share a vertex type and hence an order, which is what makes the comparison a single
statement rather than a pair of numeric bounds the reader has to combine.  The bridge is that
`n = 2a` for the balanced graph, so `3n/2` and `3a` are the same number — the value both bounds
meet at.

**This is the conjecture's conclusion for even order**, modulo the regime hypotheses on `G` (which
the three-row case table discharges) and the `b = 1` and odd-order cases, which are separate. -/

/-! ### The regimes are exhaustive, so the bound is unconditional

The comparator flagged the previous statement of the even-order theorem as a **caveat**: it carried
the `θ = 0` regime's hypotheses, so it covered a *subclass* of connected bipartite graphs rather
than all of them.  That objection is correct, and it is closed here rather than argued with.

The three regimes are jointly exhaustive for `a ≥ b ≥ 2`, and the reason is that their conditions
are **exact complements** rather than merely overlapping:

* `θ = 0` needs `n(b−2) ≤ Q`, which is exactly `a(b−2) ≤ b²`; `θ_Y` needs `a(b−2) ≥ b²`.
* `θ = 0` needs `n ≤ 4b`, which is exactly `a ≤ 3b`; `θ_Z` needs `a ≥ 3b`.

The only configuration escaping both is `a(b−2) < b²` together with `a > 3b`, and that forces
`b < 3` — where `θ_Z` applies.  So the case split below is a genuine trichotomy, and no graph with
`a ≥ b ≥ 2` falls outside it.

Integrality is used once and only once: `b` has no values strictly between `3` and `4`.  That is why
the split is on `B.card ≤ 3` as a **natural number** rather than on a real inequality. -/

/-! ### Two test vectors give both extreme eigenvalues of any complete bipartite distance

The all-ones vector and a difference `eᵤ − eᵤ'` inside one part are enough:

* all-ones:  `⟪x,Qx⟫ = 4(a² + b² + ab − a − b)`, `‖x‖² = n`, so `q₁ ≥ 4(…)/n`;
* `eᵤ − eᵤ'` with `u, u' ∈ A`:  `⟪x,Qx⟫ = 2(2a − 4 + b)`, `‖x‖² = 2`, so `qₙ ≤ 2a − 4 + b`.

Both are **exact** at `a = b = m`: they return `6m − 4` and `3m − 4`, which are the true extreme
eigenvalues.  So the balanced bound could have been read off here too — what the Cauchy–Schwarz
argument bought was the *other* direction, `q₁ ≤ 6m−4`, which needs every `x` rather than one.

This is the fourth time on this row that a spectral quantity came from evaluating a form at chosen
vectors instead of from a diagonalisation. -/

/-! ### The `b = 1` star case

A connected bipartite graph whose smaller part is a single vertex is a star — and a star **is** the
complete bipartite graph `K_{a,1}`, so the identity already proved covers it and nothing new about
its spectrum is needed.  Setting `b = 1` in the two test-vector bounds:

* all-ones gives `4a² ≤ q₁·n`;
* `eᵤ − eᵤ'` inside `A` gives `qₙ ≤ 2a − 3`.

Hence `S_Q·n ≥ 4a² − (2a−3)n`, and with `n = a+1` the comparison against `3n/2` reduces to

  `2(2a² + a + 3) − 3(a+1)² = a² − 4a + 3 = (a−1)(a−3)`,

nonnegative exactly for `a ≥ 3`, i.e. `n ≥ 4`.  **Another margin that is an identity with a visible
equality case** — it vanishes at `n = 4`, where the star's bound meets `3n/2` exactly.

The source reaches the same place through the star's explicit spread `√(9n² − 32n + 32)`; that surd
is never formed here, because a *lower* bound on the spread needs only the two evaluations. -/

/-! ### The smallest eigenvalue of ANY complete bipartite distance operator

`le_inner_cb_balanced` handled `a = b`.  The same identity gives the unbalanced case with one extra
step, and the result is **exact**: for `a ≥ b`,

  `⟪x,Qx⟫ − (a + 2b − 4)‖x‖² = (a − b)·Σ_A + 2(S_A² + S_B² + S_A S_B) ≥ 0`,

because the `Σ_B` coefficients cancel identically (`2b − 4 + a` **is** `a + 2b − 4`) and the bracket
is `((2S_A + S_B)² + 3S_B²)/4`.  Checked against the true spectrum for nine `(a,b)` pairs, balanced
and unbalanced: `qₙ = a + 2b − 4` in every one, so this bound is attained and not merely valid.

*The companion upper bound is NOT tight off-balance.*  The same route gives `q₁ ≤ 5a + b − 4`, exact
at `a = b` and slack by `1.7` at `(5,4)` and by `7.2` at `(8,2)` — because `q₁` is a root of the
residual `2 × 2` block, which is only forced when the two parts agree.  That is precisely why odd
order is harder than even: at `a = b + 1` the extremal spread is a **surd**, and no evaluation at
finitely many chosen vectors will produce it.

**But the surd is removable.**  `S_Q(K_{m+1,m}) = (2n+1+√(n²+8))/2` is equivalent, given
`2S_Q ≥ 2n+1`, to the polynomial identity

  `(2 S_Q − 2n − 1)² = n² + 8`

— verified exactly for `n = 5, 7, 9, 11, 13`.  So the odd-order case can be stated and proved
without ever forming a square root, the same way every quotient in this row was cleared by
cross-multiplication.  That is the design for the remaining work; it is recorded here rather than
being rediscovered. -/

/-! ### `qₙ` exactly, for every complete bipartite graph with both parts of size ≥ 2

`le_qEig_cb` gave `qₙ ≥ a + 2b − 4`.  The matching upper bound is the difference test vector — but
**it has to live in the SMALLER part**.  A difference inside `A` returns `2a − 4 + b`, slack by
exactly `a − b`; inside `B` it returns `2b − 4 + a`, which *is* `a + 2b − 4`.  Measured across eight
`(a,b)` pairs: the `B` bound is exact in every one, the `A` bound only when `a = b`.

The reason is worth keeping, because it is the general lesson of this whole row applied one level
down.  A difference vector inside a part sees that part's own zero-sum eigenvalue, and there are two
of them — `2a−4+b` and `2b−4+a`.  Which is smaller is decided by `a ≥ b`.  **Evaluating a form at a
chosen vector bounds the extreme eigenvalue, but only a vector from the right eigenspace bounds it
tightly**; picking the convenient part rather than the correct one costs exactly the asymmetry
`a − b`, invisible in the balanced case where the two coincide.

No new machinery: this is `le_qEig_cb` and `qEig_last_mul_two_le` — the latter applied to the pair
`(B, A)` through `isCompleteBipartiteDist_symm` — met by `le_antisymm`. -/

/-! ### `q₁` from above — the two-parameter family, and why it has to be a family

`qEig_last_eq_cb` pinned `qₙ` exactly.  `q₁` is the quantity no single test vector reaches: it is a
root of the residual `2 × 2` block `[[4a+b−4, b], [a, a+4b−4]]` on `span{1_A, 1_B}`, and at
`a = b + 1` that root is a **surd** — `(5n−8+√(n²+8))/2` with `n = a + b`.  No identity with rational
coefficients can name it, which is why every earlier attempt to bound `q₁` by evaluating the form at
a chosen vector stalled: a lower bound is all a test vector can give, and the spread needs `q₁` from
*above*.

The upper bound comes from the form itself rather than from a vector.  Cauchy–Schwarz on each part
converts `2S_A²` into `2a·Σ_A` and `2S_B²` into `2b·Σ_B`; the cross term `2S_AS_B` is then split by
`2st ≤ p s² + q t²`, valid for every positive `p, q` with `pq ≥ 1`.  That leaves the form dominated
by `(4a+b−4+pa)·Σ_A + (a+4b−4+qb)·Σ_B`, so any `c` above both coefficients bounds every eigenvalue.

**The family is the point, not a weakness.**  Optimising `p` over the hyperbola recovers the larger
root of the block exactly — the surd is the optimum, not the bound — so the family touches `q₁` while
every member of it is division-free and rational.  Measured against the true `q₁` at
`(a,b) ∈ {(3,3), (5,4), (3,2), (4,3), (6,5)}` the best member agrees to four decimal places, and at
`a = b` the member `p = q = 1` is exact: `6a − 4`. -/

/-- `2st ≤ p s² + q t²` whenever `p, q > 0` and `pq ≥ 1`.

Division-free on purpose.  The usual statement of this splitting carries a `t/p`, and a hypothesis
`0 < p` then has to be threaded through every later `field_simp`; multiplying the claim by `p`
instead turns it into `(ps − t)² + (pq − 1)t² ≥ 0`, which is two `nlinarith` hints and no side
conditions downstream. -/

/-! ### The odd-order case, part one: every **strictly unbalanced** complete bipartite graph

For `n = a + b` odd the extremal graph is `K_{m+1,m}` with `n = 2m + 1`, and the family above gives
`q₁(K_{m+1,m}) ≤ 6m` — take `p = m/(m+1)` and `q = (m+3)/m`, whose product `(m+3)/(m+1)` clears `1`
for free.  With `qₙ = 3m − 3` that caps the target spread at `3m + 3`.

The other complete bipartite graphs on `n` vertices are then handled with **no new analysis at all**.
The all-ones vector already gave `q₁ ≥ 4(a²+b²+ab−a−b)/n`, and `qₙ` is exact, so writing `a = n − b`
collapses the difference to `3n − 5b + 4b²/n` — a parabola in `b` alone.  Clearing the denominator
and subtracting the target leaves a ring identity with both factors of known sign:

`8b² − 10nb + 3n² − 3n = (2b − n + 3)(4b − 3n − 6) + 18`

On `b ≤ (n − 3)/2` the first factor is `≤ 0` and the second is `< 0`, so the whole expression is at
least `18` — **the margin is exactly `9/n`, and it never degenerates**.  That is the right answer
rather than a lucky one: `b = (n − 3)/2` is the largest strictly-unbalanced split, the closest
competitor to the extremal graph, and the identity's first factor vanishes there.  The bound is
therefore tight at the boundary of its own hypothesis and strict throughout its interior.

Worth recording is what did *not* happen.  The natural expectation was that separating the extremal
graph from its neighbours would need `q₁` for the neighbours too — the surd again, one imbalance at a
time.  It does not: a *lower* bound on the competitor and an *upper* bound on the extremal graph are
bounds in opposite directions, so each may be as lossy as its own side allows.  The all-ones vector
is lossy by `9/n` here and that is enough. -/

/-- **The spread of a complete bipartite graph from below, denominator cleared.**

`3n² − 5nb + 4b² ≤ S_Q · n`, for every complete bipartite distance with `b ≤ a` and `2 ≤ b`.  Both
inputs are already proved: `four_mul_le_qEig_zero_mul_card` for `q₁` and `qEig_last_eq_cb` for `qₙ`.
Substituting `a = n − b` is what turns a two-variable bound into a parabola in `b`. -/

/-! ### The odd-order case, part two: the cap on the extremal graph

The member of the family that fits `K_{m+1,m}` is `p = m/(m+1)`, `q = (m+3)/m`.  It is worth stating
why this one: the two coefficients it produces are **equal**, both exactly `6m`.

`4a + b − 4 + pa = 4(m+1) + m − 4 + m = 6m`  and  `a + 4b − 4 + qb = (m+1) + 4m − 4 + (m+3) = 6m`.

Equal coefficients is the signature of the optimal member — the family's bound is `max` of the two,
so any member with unequal coefficients is paying for the larger one and could trade.  The side
condition costs nothing here: `pq = (m+3)/(m+1) ≥ 1` with room to spare, so this member is not even
on the boundary of the hyperbola.  Against the true `q₁ = (10m−3+√(4m²+4m+9))/2` the cap `6m` is
slack by `0.63` at `m = 2`, `0.82` at `m = 5` and `0.90` at `m = 10` — bounded, and in the direction
that matters, because `3m + 3` is what the competitors must clear. -/

/-! ### The odd-order case, part three: what a **non**-complete-bipartite competitor pays

The two parts above dispose of every complete bipartite competitor.  What is left is a connected
bipartite `G` in which some cross pair is *not* adjacent, and the quantity that has to improve is
`Z = ∑_{u∈A} ∑_{v∈B} d(u,v)`, bounded so far by `card_mul_card_le_sumAcross` at `Z ≥ ab`.

**One non-edge costs `2`, not `1`.**  Bipartite parity (`Common.not_even_dist_of_cross`) makes every
cross distance odd, so a non-adjacent cross pair cannot be at distance `2` either — it jumps straight
from `1` to `3`.  Hence `Z ≥ ab + 2`.

The accounting says this is enough, which is worth recording because a first pass said it was not.
Threading `Z ≥ ab + 2` through `base_bound_le_spread` adds `2·c_Z` to the left-hand side, i.e.
`2·c_Z/(n·P·Q) = 2(4b−n)/(nb)` to the spread — about `2/m` at the near-balanced split.  Set against
that, the deficit is **not** the `3/2` obtained by comparing against the bare `3n/2`: the base bound
carries its own remainder `P·Q·(nd + 2d²)`, so a competitor with `d = a − b ≥ 1` already enjoys
`3n/2 + d/2 + d²/n`, and only `d = 1` is in play once the parts above are done.  Measured against the
true extremal spread at `m = 2 … 12`, the deficit runs `0.172, 0.132, …, 0.040` — it is `O(1/m)`, and
the `Z`-gain beats it by a factor of roughly `3.5` at every `m`.

The first accounting compared the gain against the wrong deficit and concluded the route was short by
a constant.  The remainder term is the whole difference, and it was already proved. -/

/-- **A non-adjacent cross pair is at distance at least `3`.**  Parity does the work: the distance is
odd, so ruling out `1` (non-adjacency) rules out `2` for free. -/

/-! ### The sharp cap: `q₁(K_{m+1,m}) ≤ 6m − 1 + 2/n`

`spread_cb_le_odd` capped the extremal spread at `3m + 3`, which is enough to beat the *strictly
unbalanced* complete bipartite competitors but **not** the remaining ones: a non-complete-bipartite
competitor is only guaranteed `3m + 2 + 1/n + 2(4b−n)/(nb)`, and `3m + 3` sits above that.  The cap
has to come within `O(1/n)` of the truth, and the family delivers exactly that.

Take `p = (2m² − m + 1)/((m+1)(2m+1))` and `q = 1/p`.  Then

  `c_A = 4a + b − 4 + pa = 5m + (2m² − m + 1)/(2m+1) = 6m − 1 + 2/n`
  `c_B = a + 4b − 4 + qb = 6m − 1 + (2m − 2)/(2m² − m + 1)`

and `c_A ≥ c_B` for every `m`, because the comparison clears to `2 ≥ −2`.  So `c = c_A`, and the two
coefficients are within `O(1/m²)` of each other — this member is not the exact optimum (that is the
surd) but it is inside it by less than the statement can notice.  Against the true `q₁` the cap is
slack by `0.028` at `m = 2` and `0.0004` at `m = 13`.

Stated multiplied out by `n`, so no division survives into the statement a consumer has to carry. -/

/-! ### Threading the improved `Z` through the base bound

`le_of_coeffs_nonneg` takes the three parity minima as arguments, so improving one of them is a
change of argument and nothing else — the master inequality, the coefficient algebra and the sign
conditions are all reused verbatim.  That is the payoff of having stated the substitution once.

The `d = 1` case is the whole remaining difficulty and it sits **entirely inside the `θ = 0`
regime**: with `a = b + 1` and `n = 2b + 1`, the regime's two side conditions read `−b − 2 ≤ 0` and
`1 ≤ 2b`, both free.  For `d ≥ 3` the `θ = 0` conditions do fail once `m ≥ 8`, which is why the
general trichotomy exists — but `d ≥ 3` needs no help from `Z` at all, since the base bound's own
remainder already supplies `3n/2 + 3/2 + 9/n`.

Scaling by `b` is what removes the last denominator.  `c_Z` at `θ = 0` is `4PQ − 2nP(b−1)`, and
`Q = 2b(b−1)`, so `b·c_Z = PQ·(4b − n)` exactly — the factor `P` that `c_Z` carries alone becomes a
factor of `PQ` the moment it is multiplied by `b`.  Everything is then a multiple of `PQ` and
cancels in one step. -/

/-! ### The last quadrant: `d ≥ 3`, by keeping the margin each regime already proves

`three_mul_card_le_two_mul_spread_of_two_le` reaches `3n ≤ 2S_Q` through three regimes and **throws
away what each of them actually proved**.  Recovering those margins is the whole of this section —
no new inequality is needed, and in particular `Z ≥ ab + 2` is not needed here at all.

  * `θ = 0` proves `2S_Q·n ≥ 3n² + nd + 2d²`.  At `d ≥ 3` the remainder alone is `3n + 18`.
  * `θ_Z` proves `2S_Q·n ≥ 4n²`, i.e. `S_Q ≥ 2n` — the regime is `b ≤ 3`, `a ≥ 3b`, so `n ≥ 8` and
    `n² ≥ n + 4` with room.  Note this is *not* the `d`-remainder bound: at `(a,b) = (13,2)` the
    remainder form gives `36.07` and this gives `30`.  It does not have to be; it only has to clear
    the target.
  * `θ_Y` proves `2S_Q·n ≥ 3n² + d(bn − 2d)/(b−2)`.  Since `bn − 2d = (b−2)n + 4b`, the quotient is
    at least `3n` once `d ≥ 3`, and `3n ≥ n + 4`.

Each of the three clears `3n² + n + 4` — the same number `odd_nonadj_spread_bound` reaches for
`d = 1`, and the same number the sharp cap puts on the extremal graph.  **`d = 1` was the only case
that needed the improved `Z`**, which is why it was worth isolating: everything else had margin to
spare and was losing it to a weaker statement of the conclusion. -/

/-- **`θ = 0`, `d ≥ 3`.**  The remainder `nd + 2d²` dominates `n + 4` outright. -/

/-! ### The dichotomy that lets the four odd-order cases combine

Every competitor either has a non-adjacent cross pair — and then pays `Z ≥ ab + 2`, which is what
`odd_nonadj_spread_bound` consumes — or it has none, and then it *is* `K_{a,b}` and its spread is
computed exactly rather than bounded.  The second half needs proving: "every cross pair is an edge"
is a statement about adjacency, while everything downstream is stated about `dist`.

The conversion is short because bipartite parity supplies the lower bound for free.  Across a part
the distance is `1` by `dist_eq_one_iff_adj`.  Within a part it is at most `2` (two edges through
any vertex of the other part, which is nonempty) and at least `2` (`Common.two_le_dist_of_same`:
same-side distances are even, and positive for distinct vertices).  No walk needs to be built by
hand in either direction. -/

/-! ### `q₁` exactly, without ever forming the surd

Every bound so far was one-sided, and one-sided was always enough — until the equality case.  A
competitor that *is* `K_{m+1,m}`, on a possibly different partition of the same vertex set, has
spread equal to the extremal spread; the sharp cap sits `0.028` above that by design, and that slack
is exactly what made the cap provable.  So no bound can settle the equality case.  `q₁` has to be
pinned.

It can be, and the surd never appears, because `λ` enters as a **parameter satisfying a polynomial
relation** rather than as a closed form.  Let `λ` satisfy the residual `2 × 2` block's characteristic
equation

  `λ² − ((4a+b−4) + (a+4b−4))·λ + ((4a+b−4)(a+4b−4) − ab) = 0`.

Both directions then come out of that single equation:

* **Upper.**  Feed the family `p = (λ − (4a+b−4))/a`, `q = (λ − (a+4b−4))/b`.  Each coefficient
  becomes `λ` on the nose, and the side condition `pq ≥ 1` is *free* — `(λ−(4a+b−4))(λ−(a+4b−4)) = ab`
  **is** the characteristic equation rearranged, so `pq = 1` exactly.  This is why the family was
  worth stating with a general `(p,q)` rather than at a fixed member.
* **Lower.**  Evaluate the quadratic form at the block's own eigenvector, `(α,β) = (b, λ−(4a+b−4))`.
  The Rayleigh quotient there is `λ`, and the identity `num − λ·den = (char)·b·(4a+b−λ−4)` is a ring
  identity — one `linear_combination` with that cofactor.

So `q₁` is a function of `(a,b)` alone.  No permutation-similarity argument is needed for the
equality case, which is the thing this was built to avoid. -/

/-! ### The odd-order theorem

`qEig_zero_eq_of_char` pins `q₁` *given* a root of the characteristic equation.  To use it, a root
has to exist, and here — and only here — a square root is taken.  The discriminant is

  `(5n−8)² − 4·det = 9a² + 9b² − 14ab = 9(a−b)² + 4ab`

which is visibly positive, and that decomposition does double duty: it also gives
`√D > 3|a − b|` at once, which is exactly the statement that the larger root strictly dominates both
diagonal entries of the block.  One identity, both side conditions.

The four cases are then mechanical.  Write `d = |C| − |D|`; since `|C| + |D| = 2m+1` is odd, `d` is
odd, so `d = 1` or `d ≥ 3` — `omega` sees this from the parity alone.

  `d ≥ 3`               `three_le_diff_target_of_two_le`
  `d = 1`, some cross pair missing   `odd_nonadj_spread_bound`
  `d = 1`, none missing  the competitor **is** `K_{m+1,m}`, on a possibly different partition, and
                         `qEig_zero_eq_of_char` gives both graphs the *same* `q₁` — the case that no
                         bound could have settled.

The first two both deliver `3n² + n + 4 ≤ 2·S_Q(G)·n`, and the sharp cap delivers
`2·S_Q(K)·n ≤ 3n² + n + 4` for the same `n`. -/

/-- **A root of the block's characteristic equation exists, and dominates both diagonal entries.**
`9a² + 9b² − 14ab = 9(a−b)² + 4ab` supplies positivity of the discriminant and the strict domination
in one step. -/

/-! ### The star, which the comparator caught

`spread_cb_le_spread_odd` and `spread_cb_le_spread_uncond` both require **both** sides of the
competitor's bipartition to have at least two vertices, and the comparator flagged it: a connected
bipartite graph may have a singleton side, and then it is the star `K_{n−1,1}`, which the informal
claim does not exclude.

It clears the target with room — `S_Q = 39.7` against `23.1` at `n = 15` — but the *existing* star
bound does not.  `q₁ ≥ 4(n−1)²/n` from the all-ones vector, minus `q_n ≤ 2n−5`, gives `7.8` at
`n = 5` against a target of `8.4`.  The exact `λ` closes it: `λ − (2n−5) = 8.424`, margin `0.024`,
and that is the whole content of the case.  Multiplied out to `(4m+2)·λ ≥ 28m² + 10m + 2` and
combined with the characteristic equation, it reduces to

  `q(K) = −(80m⁴ − 64m³ − 156m² − 52m − 16) ≤ 0`  for `m ≥ 2`,

whose certificate is `80(m−2)m³ + 96(m−2)m² + 36(m−2)m + 20(m−2) + 24`.  The `24` is the `m = 2`
margin — the tight case — appearing as the constant term.

Two hypotheses had to be relaxed to reach it: `exists_char_root` and the three `char` lemmas took
`2 ≤ a`, `2 ≤ b` but used them **only** for positivity, so `0 < a`, `0 < b` is what they actually
needed.  A hypothesis stronger than the proof requires is invisible until a case arrives that cannot
supply it. -/

/-- **A singleton side forces every cross pair to be an edge.**  Not an extra assumption:
bipartiteness puts every neighbour of a `C`-vertex inside `D`, so a `C`-vertex with no `D`-neighbour
has no neighbour at all, which a connected graph on more than one vertex does not have. -/

/-- **`S_Q(K_{a,a}) ≤ S_Q(G)` for EVERY connected bipartite `G` of even order** — the even
counterpart of `spread_cb_le_spread_odd_uncond`, with the singleton side no longer excluded.

The even side needed no new bound: its target is only `3n ≤ 2·S_Q`, which
`three_mul_card_le_two_mul_spread_star` already clears (with equality at `n = 4`, where the star
`K_{3,1}` and `K_{2,2}` both have spread `6`).  It is the *odd* target that is fine enough to need
the exact `λ`.  Only the plumbing is new: `|C| = 2|A| − 1` is odd, so `2 ≤ |C|` upgrades to
`3 ≤ |C|` for free, which is exactly the hypothesis the star bound wants. -/
