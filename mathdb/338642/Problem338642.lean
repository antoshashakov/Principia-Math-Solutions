# MathDB #338642 — the exact excess of the Bovdi–Leung system `𝒟`

MathDB open problem #338642.  For `k ≥ 2` put `n = 4k+7`, `m = 4k`, `r = 2k`.  Section 4 of Bovdi
and Leung's construction produces a maximal commutative algebraic system `𝒟 ⊆ 𝒫ₙ(*)` whose only
layers are one exceptional layer at `r+3` of size `7B₀ + 21B₁ + 7B₂ + B₃`, together with every odd
layer from `r+5` upward, which is full.  The source conjectures `|𝒟| / 2^(n-2) → 1`.

The campaign result is the **exact identity**, which is strictly stronger:

  `|𝒟| − 2^(n-2) = 2(4k+3)(2k−1) / ((2k+1)(2k+2)) · C(4k, 2k)`

so the excess is strictly positive for every `k ≥ 2` — matching the source's finite computations —
and the normalized excess tends to zero.  Campaign source:
`mathdb-open-problems/problems/338642/` in the collaborator repository
`antoshashakov/Principia-Math-In-Progress`.

## What is assumed and what is proved

As in `Problem338641`, the **layer data is an input, not a theorem here**: that `𝒟` has exactly
these layers is a fact about Bovdi–Leung's construction, so it enters as the hypothesis
`DLayerData` — never as an `axiom`.  Lean certifies the implication, which is the part the campaign
derived.

## Reuse

This problem is the twin of #338641 and shares its machinery, so the odd-tail evaluation
(`two_mul_tail_five`), the first Vandermonde collection (`vandermonde_six`), the central-binomial
square bound and its limit (`central_ratio_tendsto_zero`) are **imported from `Problem338641`**
rather than restated.  Only the two adjacent-binomial recurrences `B₁/B₀ = 2k/(2k+1)` and
`B₂/B₁ = (2k−1)/(2k+2)` — which #338641 never needed, because its deficit collapsed to a multiple
of `B₀` alone — are new.

## Statement shapes

`ℕ` subtraction truncates, so the identity is stated additively as
`D + 3 * B k 0 = 2^(4k+5) + 6 * B k 1 + B k 2` (Lemma `D_add_three_central`); the source's boxed
rational form is `D_excess_exact`, over `ℝ`, where subtraction is honest.  `4k+5 = n-2`.

/-! ### The two adjacent-binomial recurrences

multiple of `B₀` alone, whereas here `B₁` and `B₂` survive the cancellation and must be converted
into `B₀`. -/

which is exactly what validates the decomposition: nothing here inspects the construction. -/
