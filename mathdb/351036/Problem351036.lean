# MathDB #351036 — the literal record is FALSE; the repaired sum is integral

MathDB open problem #351036.  For positive integers `n, a, d` put

  `M_i(a,d) = ∑_{r<d} a^{r i}`,   `E_k(n,a,d) = (1/φ(n)) ∑_{i=1}^{φ(n)} gcd(n, M_i(a,d)) ζ_k^i`

with `ζ_k` a primitive `k`-th root of unity.  The MathDB record asserts `E_k(n,a,d) ∈ ℤ` with **no
condition on `k`**.

Two results, both proved here.

1. **The literal record is false** (`literal_statement_false`).  At `(n,a,d,k) = (2,2,1,3)` we have
   `φ(2) = 1` and `M_1(2,1) = 1`, so the sum is `ζ_3`, which is not a rational integer.  The
   source's own context supplies the omitted hypothesis `k ∣ φ(n)`, which fails here (`3 ∤ 1`).
2. **The repaired statement is true** (`integrality`): `k ∣ φ(n)` implies `E_k(n,a,d) ∈ ℤ` for all
   positive `n, a, d`.

## What is assumed

Exactly one thing: **Theorem 3.1 of the source, for a prime base** (`SourceThm31Prime`), the
integer exponent of a cyclotomic factor in the rational partial zeta function of a function
field.  The source states it for prime *powers*; only the prime case is assumed here, because
Dirichlet supplies a prime.  Formalizing it is a separate project, so it enters as a named
hypothesis and never as an `axiom`.

Everything else is proved, including the two steps the write-up delegates to the literature:

* the **transfer to a general coprime base** (`coprime_case`), which needs a prime `q ≡ a (mod n)`
  — that is Dirichlet's theorem on primes in arithmetic progressions, and Mathlib has it
  (`Nat.forall_exists_prime_gt_and_modEq`), so this is a theorem here rather than an assumption;
* the **reduction of the general case to the coprime case** (`integrality`), via the coprime-part
  splitting `n = n₀ n₁` (`exists_coprime_part`, proved by peeling one prime at a time), the
  observation that `p ∣ a` forces `M_i ≡ 1 (mod p)` so `n₁` contributes nothing to the gcd, and
  the vanishing of the inner geometric sum when `k ∤ φ(n₀)`.

## The reusable half

`sum_split` and `geom_vanish` are campaign-agnostic: a Fourier sum of a weight that is periodic
with period `h₀`, taken over `L` full periods, factors as (geometric sum in `w = ζ^{h₀}`) × (sum
over one period), and that geometric factor vanishes unless `w = 1`.  Neither mentions gcds,
totients or roots of unity, and both belong in `Common/` on promotion.

## Statement shape

`E` sums over `Icc 1 (φ n)`, matching the source's `∑_{i=1}^{φ(n)}` literally;
`sum_Icc_one_eq_range` is the bridge to the `range`-indexed form the proofs use.

`integrality` carries no `0 < a` hypothesis.  The source states its result for positive `a`; the
proof never uses positivity, so the formal statement covers `a = 0` too.  That is a broadening,
not a narrowing -- the claimed domain is a strict subset of the proved one.

because Dirichlet hands it a prime.  The source states it for prime *powers*, so this hypothesis
is strictly weaker than the source theorem, and the name says so: assuming less makes
`integrality` stronger.  It is the integer exponent of a cyclotomic factor in a rational partial
zeta function.  This is the one input this file does not prove; a hypothesis, never an `axiom`. -/

/-- **The coprime case.**  Dirichlet's theorem supplies a prime `q ≡ a (mod n)`; congruent bases
give the same gcd weights, so `E` is unchanged and Theorem 3.1 applies.  This step is a *theorem*

/-- **MathDB #351036, part two: the repaired statement is true.**  For all positive `n, a, d` and
every primitive `k`-th root of unity with `k ∣ φ(n)`, `E_k(n,a,d)` is a rational integer.

The proof splits `n = n₀ n₁` with `n₀` coprime to `a`; the factor `n₁` is invisible to every gcd
because `p ∣ a` forces `M_i ≡ 1 (mod p)`.  The weight is then periodic with period `φ(n₀)`, and
the Fourier sum over `φ(n) = φ(n₀) φ(n₁)` terms factors.  Either `ζ^{φ(n₀)} ≠ 1`, and the
geometric factor kills the whole sum, or `ζ^{φ(n₀)} = 1`, and what survives is exactly
