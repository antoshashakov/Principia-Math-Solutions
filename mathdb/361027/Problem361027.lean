# MathDB #361027 — signed edge colouring of two cliques joined by an edge (definitions)

MathDB open problem #361027, Conjecture 26 of Janczewski–Turowski–Wróblewski.  Let `G_n` be the
graph obtained from two vertex-disjoint copies of `K_n` by adding one edge between them.  The
conjecture asserts that for **every** signature `σ : E(G_n) → {±1}`,

  `χ'(G_n, σ) = Δ(G_n) = n`.

Mathlib has no signed graphs and no edge colouring of any kind, so this module builds the
definitions before any of the mathematics.  It contains the colour set, the graph, its maximum
degree, and the lower bound `χ' ≥ Δ`.  **It does not claim the conjecture**; the construction
(Walecki decompositions, then the colouring) is built in later work.

## The conventions, which are the source's

A signed `k`-edge-colouring assigns a colour to every **incidence** `(u : uv)`, not to every edge,
from the set

  `M k = {0, ±1, …, ±ℓ}` if `k = 2ℓ+1`,   `M k = {±1, …, ±ℓ}` if `k = 2ℓ`,

which has exactly `k` elements either way.  The two incidences of an edge are tied by

  `f(u : uv) = -σ(uv) · f(v : uv)`,

and the colours at incidences sharing a vertex must be distinct.  Note the balance condition means
a colour and its negative are *not* interchangeable: which of `±j` sits at which end is forced by
the sign, and this is exactly what makes the problem depend on `σ` at all.

## Two encoding choices

The vertex set is `Fin (m+1) ⊕ Fin (m+1)` with `n = m + 1`, rather than `Fin n` carrying `0 < n`
alongside, so the joining vertices are literally `Sum.inl 0` and `Sum.inr 0` and no proof term
travels inside a vertex.  The case `n = 0` is not a case of the conjecture.

The graph is built with `SimpleGraph.fromRel`, which supplies symmetry and irreflexivity, rather
than by giving the structure fields directly — their types are `Std.Symm` and `Std.Irrefl`, which
are classes rather than the plain propositions they resemble, and `intro` will not unfold them.
`G_adj` recovers the intended adjacency, and everything downstream uses that rather than the
definition.

Computed from the neighbour Finsets rather than from `∑ w, if Adj v w then 1 else 0`.  The sum
form drags the adjacency's `Decidable` instance through every rewrite, and the mismatches surface
as "typeclass instance problem is stuck" and "motive is not type correct" — errors that name the
rewrite rather than the instance.  An explicit Finset has one decidability obligation, on
`DecidableEq (Fin (m+1))`, which is canonical. -/

/-! ### The Walecki vertex sequence

The source's Hamilton cycle `C_i = (∞, i, i-1, i+1, i-2, i+2, …, i-(m-1), i+(m-1), i-m, ∞)` on
`{∞} ∪ ZMod (2m)`, with `∞` deleted, is the vertex sequence

  `w i 0 = i`,  `w i 1 = i-1`,  `w i 2 = i+1`,  `w i 3 = i-2`,  …,  `w i (2m-1) = i-m`,

that is `w i (2j) = i + j` and `w i (2j+1) = i - (j+1)`.

Two facts drive everything.  The sequence is injective on `t < 2m`, so each `P_i` really is a
path; and consecutive vertices have **endpoint sum** `2i - 1` when the first index is even and
`2i` when it is odd.  The endpoint sum is what separates the two families of edges and, in the
next stage, lets an edge be traced back to the unique path carrying it.

Note that Hamiltonicity is never needed downstream.  Each vertex has degree `2m-1`, sits on each
of the `m` paths with local degree `0`, `1` or `2`, and the only way `m` terms from `{0,1,2}` sum
to `2m-1` is one `1` and `m-1` twos — so "endpoint of exactly one path, internal on the rest"
falls out of the edge partition and degree counting alone. -/

/-! ### The Walecki edges, and why no two coincide

The `p`-th path contributes the edges `{w p t, w p (t+1)}` for `t + 1 < 2m`, so `m` paths
contribute `m(2m-1)` edges in all — exactly `|E(K_{2m})|`.  Injectivity of `(p, t) ↦ edge` is
therefore the whole decomposition: surjectivity is then pure counting.

The proof separates the two indices.  The **endpoint sum** is `2p - 1` from an even position and
`2p` from an odd one, and it is invariant under swapping the ends of the edge, so it survives the
passage to `Sym2`.  Matching sums forces `p = p'` — and in the mixed-parity case forces
`2(p - p') = 1`, which multiplied by `m` gives `m = 0` in `ZMod (2m)`, impossible for `m ≥ 1`.
That last step needs no parity homomorphism: `2m = 0` is all the arithmetic involved.

With `p` pinned, `t` follows from injectivity of the vertex sequence alone.  Either the two edges
agree end-for-end, giving `t = t'`, or they agree crosswise, giving `t = t' + 1` and `t + 1 = t'`
at once. -/

/-! ### Hamiltonicity is free, and each vertex ends exactly one path

`w p ·` is injective on `t < 2m` into a type of exactly `2m` elements, so it is a **bijection** —
each path visits every vertex exactly once, with no separate argument.

The endpoints of `P_p` are `w p 0 = p` and `w p (2m-1) = p - m`.  So `v` ends `P_p` exactly when
`p = v` or `p = v + m` as elements of `ZMod (2m)`, and of the two natural representatives `v.val`
and `v.val ± m` precisely one lies below `m`.  Hence **every vertex is an endpoint of exactly one
path** — the fact the colouring argument runs on, obtained directly rather than by counting local
degrees. -/

/-! ### The decomposition

`m` paths of `2m-1` edges is `m(2m-1)` edges, and `K_{2m}` has `(2m choose 2) = m(2m-1)` of them.
Injectivity of `(p, t) ↦ edge` therefore forces **surjectivity**, by cardinality alone: every
unordered pair of distinct vertices is a Walecki edge, at exactly one path and one position.

This is the point of doing injectivity first.  The source verifies surjectivity directly, by
checking that for each endpoint sum the listed pairs exhaust the pairs with that sum; counting
gets the same conclusion from work already done.

The statement is phrased on a pair `u ≠ v` rather than on `edgeFinset`.  `edgeFinset` carries a
`Fintype ↑⊤.edgeSet` obligation that must be discharged when the STATEMENT is elaborated, and the
instances it needs (`NeZero (2m)`, and decidability of `⊤`'s adjacency) are exactly what a `haveI`
inside the proof arrives too late to supply.  Keeping the complete graph internal costs nothing
and keeps the interface free of instance arguments. -/

/-! ### Colouring one path

A path can be coloured with a single pair `{±c}` **whatever the signs on its edges** — this is the
observation the source opens with, and it is why the construction goes through paths rather than
matchings.  Fix the colour at the first incidence and propagate: the balance condition determines
the colour at the far end of each edge, and the properness condition at an internal vertex then
determines the colour at the near end of the next.

Concretely, carry a sign `sgn p t ∈ {±1}` with `sgn p 0 = 1` and `sgn p (t+1) = sgn p t · σ(e_t)`.
The incidence at `w p t` pointing along `e_t` gets `sgn p t · c`, and the incidence at
`w p (t+1)` pointing back gets `-sgn p (t+1) · c`.

Two facts fall out, and they are the only two the assembly needs.  Balance holds by construction,
using nothing about `σ` beyond `σ² = 1`.  And at an **internal** vertex the two incidences are
`sgn p (t+1) · c` and `-sgn p (t+1) · c` — negatives, hence distinct, hence proper — with no
reference to the signs at all.  The signature is absorbed entirely into `sgn`. -/

/-! ### From the decomposition to a colouring of the clique

Every pair `u ≠ v` lies on exactly one path at exactly one position, so `locate` can name that
`(path, position)` and `col` can read off the incidence colour.  `locate` is total — junk on the
diagonal — rather than carrying `u ≠ v` as an argument, because a proof-carrying definition would
force every later statement to thread the same proof through.

The one thing that has to be checked rather than assumed is that `locate` does not depend on the
ORDER of `u` and `v`.  `s(u,v)` and `s(v,u)` are propositionally equal but not the same term, so
the two `Classical.choose` calls could in principle land on different witnesses; `locate_symm`
rules that out via uniqueness, and every later argument uses it. -/

/-! ### The clique is properly coloured

Two conditions remain for a single copy of `K_{2m}`.

**Balance** is `colFwd_eq` plus bookkeeping: `locate_symm` guarantees `col u v` and `col v u` read
the *same* edge, and `locate_ends` says which end each of them sits at.  When `u` is the far end
the identity comes back multiplied by `-σ`, and `σ² = 1` together with the symmetry of the
signature returns it.

**Properness** splits on whether the two incidences come from the same path.  Different paths give
different absolute values, `p+1` against `p'+1`, so nothing more is needed.  The same path forces
`u` to sit at one position on it, and the two edges must then be the two edges at that position —
one entered, one left — whose colours are negatives of each other.  The degenerate possibility,
that the two edges coincide, is excluded because that would make `v = v'`. -/

/-! ### Two tools for the join

Neither is about Walecki, so both are stated for an arbitrary vertex type.

**Flipping a colour class.**  Negating every incidence whose colour has a given absolute value
preserves all three conditions.  This is the source's "reversing all incidence colours on one
path", in the only form the assembly needs — and stated on absolute values rather than on paths it
needs no path structure at all.  It is what supplies the freedom to choose which of `±c` is the
colour missing at a vertex, and hence to satisfy the joining edge's balance condition.

**A colour is always missing.**  A vertex of a clique on `k` vertices has `k-1` neighbours, its
incidence colours are distinct and lie in `M k`, and `|M k| = k`.  So one colour is unused.  Pure
counting; no structure enters. -/

/-! ### The clique colouring as a bundle, and how to move it

`CliqueColouring V k sg` packages the three conditions on a complete graph.  Bundling them buys
three things the assembly needs and that are awkward as loose lemmas: the even-order construction
becomes a single named object, flipping a colour class becomes an operation on that object, and
**transport along an equivalence** becomes one definition rather than a rewrite at every use.

Transport is what reconciles the two indexings.  The graph's cliques are `Fin (n)` with `n = m+1`,
while the Walecki construction lives on `ZMod (2μ)`.  `ZMod (m+1)` reduces to `Fin (m+1)` — `ZMod`
is defined by cases and `m+1` is a syntactic successor — so the only gap is between `ZMod (m+1)`
and `ZMod (2μ)` when `m + 1 = 2μ`.  That is a propositional equality of naturals, hence a
propositional equality of types via `congrArg ZMod`, hence an `Equiv.cast`.  No `Fin n ≃ ZMod n`
is needed and nothing has to be rebuilt.

Note the signature travels backwards: to colour `V` one transports a colouring of `W` built for
the signature pulled back along `e.symm`. -/

/-! ### Basepoint-preserving transport

`CliqueColouring.transport` moves a colouring along any equivalence, and that is not enough for
the join.  The two joining vertices need missing colours `x` and `y` with `x = -σ(e)·y`, and
`flipAt` can change a sign but never an absolute value — so `|x| = |y|` has to come from the
construction.  It does: `pathOf 0 = 0`, so the clique's vertex `0` ends path `0` and misses a
colour of absolute value `1`.  But that is a fact about the vertex `0` **of `ZMod (2m)`**, and an
arbitrary equivalence need not send the graph's joining vertex there.

`atBasepoint` repairs any equivalence into one that does, by composing with the transposition that
swaps the image of the chosen point with the chosen target.  Nothing else about the equivalence
changes, so the transported colouring is still a colouring. -/

Declared in the root `Equiv` namespace rather than with a `_root_.` prefix inside

/-! ### The odd decomposition

`K_{2m+1}` is handled on `Option (ZMod (2m)) = {∞} ∪ ℤ_{2m}`, **not** on `ZMod (2m+1)`: `∞` is
internal to every path and is the vertex the matching misses, which is exactly why it misses only
the colour `0`.

The decomposition is Walecki's second consequence.  Each cycle `C_p` runs
`∞, w p 0, …, w p (2m-1), ∞`; deleting its *central* edge — the one joining positions `m-1` and `m`
of the finite stretch — leaves a Hamilton path on all `2m+1` vertices, and the `m` deleted edges are
precisely the diameter perfect matching of `ℤ_{2m}`.

**This reuses the even case rather than repeating it.**  The finite edges of the `p`-th path are
exactly the Walecki edges `s(w p t, w p (t+1))` for every `t ≠ m-1`, so `edge_inj` and `edge_surj`
carry over verbatim on that restriction.  What is genuinely new is only what is proved below: that
the central edges join antipodes and cover `ℤ_{2m}`, and that the `2m` edges at `∞` hit every
residue once. -/

/-! ### Odd colours, and the bridge back to the even decomposition

Two things are set up here.

**The colours.**  `colFwd` assigns magnitude `p + 1` — the *path index*, never the position — and
absorbs the whole signature into the carried sign.  So the `m` odd paths take magnitudes `1 … m`
and the matching takes `0`, which is exactly `M (2m+1) = [-m, m]`.  The sign has to be
re-accumulated along the odd path's own traversal order, because that order visits `σ` at `∞` as
well; but once `osgn` is defined the balance and internal-negation proofs are the even ones word
for word, since neither mentions the path.

**The bridge.**  The `p`-th odd path's edge at position `s` is, for every `s` other than the two
straddling `∞`, a Walecki edge — and `widx` says which one.  Positions `0 … m-2` walk `t` down from
`m-2` to `0`, positions `m+1 … 2m-1` walk `t` down from `2m-2` to `m`, and the index `m-1` that
would be the central edge is exactly the one never hit.  This is what lets `edge_inj` and
`edge_surj` be reused instead of reproved. -/

/-! ### Every pair is a matching edge or a path edge

The three cases separate without an argument.  An antipodal pair *is* a central edge — there are
`m` of each, the central ones are antipodal by `central_diff`, and `edge_surj` says every pair
occurs exactly once, so counting forces the identification.  Only one direction is needed below,
and `central_diff` gives it alone.

The consequence is that the `t` returned by `edge_surj` for a non-antipodal pair automatically
avoids `m-1`, which is exactly the index `widx` never produces.  `spos` inverts `widx` on what
remains. -/

/-! ### Uniqueness

`∞` does the case split for free.  Whether a path edge contains `∞` is a property of the *edge*,
so it transfers across an equality of edges without touching either side — and it is equivalent to
the position being `m-1` or `m`.  So the two edges are either both incident to `∞` or both finite,
and the remaining work splits into a four-case check on `∞`'s edges and one appeal to `edge_inj`
for the finite ones.

`w_step` completes the antipodal/central identification in the direction stage 12b did not need:
consecutive path vertices differ by `±(t+1)`, so an antipodal pair forces `t+1 = m`. Together with
`central_of_antipodal` this says the central edges are *exactly* the antipodal pairs, which is what
makes the matching's colour `0` well defined. -/

/-! ### The odd colouring 

`ocol` reads the incidence colour off `olocate`, exactly as the even `col` reads it off `locate`.
The one structural difference is the `else` branch: a matching edge is **not** a path edge, so it
falls through — and it falls through to `0`, which is precisely the colour it should carry.  That
the two branches are exclusive is `central_of_antipodal_conv` together with the fact that `widx`
never produces `m-1`.

`ocol_proper` then splits three ways at a vertex `u`, and only the first is real work:
  * both incidences on path edges — the even argument, via `ocolBwd_eq_neg_ocolFwd`;
  * one path, one matching — the matching gives `0` and a path gives `±(p+1) ≠ 0`;
  * both matching — impossible, since `v = u + m` determines `v`.

/-! ### The odd path is Hamiltonian, and the colour's magnitude

`vidx` is to *vertices* what `widx` is to *edges*: it maps a position on the odd path to the
Walecki position carrying it.  Positions `0 … m-1` walk `t` down from `m-1` to `0`, positions
`m+1 … 2m` walk `t` down from `2m-1` to `m`, and `∞` sits at `m`.  The two runs cover `[0, m-1]`
and `[m, 2m-1]` — every Walecki position exactly once — so the `2m+1` positions carry `2m+1`
distinct vertices and the odd path is Hamiltonian.  As with `widx`, the injectivity is a range
argument, not a computation. -/

/-! ### Balance and properness for the odd clique

Balance runs as in the even case, with one extra branch: a matching edge gives `0` at both ends and
`0 = -σ·0` for either sign, so the condition holds without any appeal to the signature.

Properness splits three ways at a vertex `u`, and only the first is the even argument:
  * both incidences on path edges — same-path means `u` is internal, so the two colours are
    negatives of a nonzero number; different paths means different magnitudes;
  * one path, one matching — the matching gives `0` and a path colour is never `0`;
  * both matching — impossible, because `v = u + m` determines `v`.

/-! ### Which colour is missing, and why the join can match the two cliques

The join needs the two joining vertices to miss colours `x` and `y` with `x = -σ(e)·y`.  `flipAt`
can change a sign but never a magnitude, so `|x| = |y|` has to come from the construction.

It does, and more cheaply than the earlier design note assumed.  The missing colour's magnitude is
`pathOf v + 1` — determined by *which path `v` ends*, and in particular **independent of the
signature**.  So the two cliques, carrying different signatures, still miss colours of the same
magnitude at the same basepoint, and the basepoint may be any vertex rather than `0` specifically.

The mechanism: `v` is internal on every path it does not end, and the two incidences at an internal
vertex are negatives of one another (`colBwd_eq_neg_colFwd`).  So for every path `p` other than
`pathOf v`, *both* signs of `p+1` already occur at `v` — leaving only `±(pathOf v + 1)` available
to be missing. -/

/-! ### Moving the missing colour, and the shape of the join

`SignedColouring` conditions everything on **adjacency**, not on `u ≠ v`, which is what makes the
assembly cheap: away from the two joining vertices each half is exactly its clique colouring, and
the only new obligation is at `inl 0` and `inr 0`.

What the joining edge needs is `x = -σ·y` where `x` is missing at `inl 0` and `y` at `inr 0`.
Stage 16 gives `|x| = |y|` for free — the missing magnitude is `pathOf(basepoint) + 1`, which does
not depend on the signature — so the two differ at most in sign, and `flip_missing` supplies the
sign. -/

/-! ### Both constructions, moved onto `Fin n`

The graph's cliques are `Fin (m+1)`; the constructions live on `ZMod (2μ)` and on
`Option (ZMod (2μ))`.  `Fintype.equivOfCardEq` supplies *an* equivalence and `Equiv.atBasepoint`
repairs it into one that sends the chosen basepoint where the join needs it — to `0` in the even
case, to `∞` in the odd one.

Two things about the shape of these statements, each of which cost a build.

**The basepoint is a parameter, not the numeral `0`.**  Writing `0 : Fin n` fails: `Fin n` has an
`OfNat` instance only when `n` is a syntactic successor, and `hn : n = 2 * μ` is a hypothesis, not
a reduction — so the numeral cannot elaborate in the *statement*, where no `subst` has happened
yet.  Taking `u₀ : Fin n` avoids the question, and the caller supplies `0 : Fin (m+1)`, which is
fine because `m+1` *is* a successor.

**The equivalence is obtained, not `let`-bound.**  A `let e := …` leaves occurrences that are
sometimes the body and sometimes the name, and `rw [he0]` then reports it cannot find `e 0` in a
goal displaying exactly `none = e 0`.  `obtain ⟨e, he0⟩ : ∃ e, …` makes `e` genuinely opaque.

Each `subst` below is on `n = 2 * μ` or `n = 2 * μ + 1`, where only the left side is a variable, so
the direction is forced — the case the earlier `subst` trap does not cover. -/

/-! ### The assembly

`SignedColouring` conditions `mem`, `bal` and `proper` on **adjacency**, not on `u ≠ v`.  Away from
the two joining vertices each half is therefore verbatim its clique colouring, and the only new
obligations sit at `inl 0` and `inr 0`.

`IsSignature` constrains `s` only on adjacent pairs, while a `CliqueColouring` wants `±1`
everywhere, so each clique is given a diagonal-normalised signature `if a = b then 1 else s …`,
which agrees with `s` on every edge and is `1` on the diagonal that no condition inspects.

The joining edge carries `x` at the `inl` end and `-σ·x` at the `inr` end, where `x` is the colour
missing at `inl 0`.  Balance is then `σ² = 1`, and properness at each joining vertex is exactly the
missing-colour property.  What makes this possible is stage 16: both cliques miss colours of the
*same magnitude*, since that magnitude depends only on the order.  `flipAt` then matches the sign. -/
