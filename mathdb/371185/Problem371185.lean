# MathDB #371185 — tie-breaking changes a player's utility by at most `min S − 1`

MathDB open problem #371185.  In the *cumulative subtraction game* on a nonempty subtraction set
`S ⊆ ℕ`, two players alternately remove `s ∈ S` stones from a heap of `h` and bank them.  Play
stops when no move is possible.  A deterministic tie-breaking convention resolves indifference
between moves that give the mover the same maximal utility; different conventions can select
different equilibria.  The source conjectures that, for fixed `S`, the resulting discrepancies in
the players' utilities stay bounded as `h` grows.

The campaign result is sharper: writing `m = min S`, **every player's discrepancy is at most
`m − 1`**, uniformly in `h` and in the two conventions.

## The shape of the proof, and what this file proves

The argument has two halves, and this file proves both.

1. `nash_close_fst` / `nash_close_snd` — a general fact about **almost-constant-sum** games: if
   every payoff sum lies in `[C, C+R]`, then any two Nash equilibria give each player utilities
   within `R`.  Four best-response and bound inequalities, no game structure at all.
2. `play_sum_le` / `play_sum_ge` — in the subtraction game the terminal remainder `r` satisfies
   `0 ≤ r < m`, because play stops only when no move fits.  Every removed stone is banked by
   exactly one player, so `u₁ + u₂ = h − r ∈ [h − m + 1, h]`.  This is `C = h − m + 1`, `R = m − 1`,
   and the bound `m − 1` is independent of `h` — which is the conjecture.

`tie_break_discrepancy` composes them.  It is stated for **any two Nash equilibria** of the game,
which is strictly more general than "any two deterministic tie-breaking conventions": backward
induction under such a convention produces a subgame-perfect, hence Nash, equilibrium of the same
game — a textbook fact about finite extensive-form games that is not restated here, and is not
needed, because quantifying over all Nash equilibria already covers every convention.

## Modelling choices

* Play is defined by **fuel-bounded structural recursion** (`playFuel`) rather than well-founded
  recursion, and `play` supplies `n` units of fuel to a heap of `n`.  Every move removes at least
  one stone, so `n` moves can never be exhausted early; the fuel is a proof device, not a cap.
* A strategy is a function from heap size to the amount to remove, and the players' strategy space
  is the **legal** strategies (`LegalStrategy`): a player who could move must name a move that is
  in `S`, positive, and no larger than the heap.  Nash equilibrium therefore quantifies over legal
  deviations only, as it must — an illegal "deviation" is not available in the game.
* `S : Set ℕ` may be infinite; only `m ∈ S` and `m` positive are used, matching the source's
  remark that only `S ∩ [1, h]` can occur.

## Sharpness

`sharp_two_by_two` exhibits, for every `R ≥ 0`, an almost-constant-sum game with two Nash
equilibria whose first-player utilities differ by exactly `R` — so the constant in the lemma cannot
be improved.  The source additionally exhibits game-level sharpness at `S = {3, 5, 8}`, `h = 23`
(utilities `(13, 10)` against `(13, 8)`, a second-player discrepancy of `2 = m − 1`); that witness
needs the backward-induction recurrence and is **not** formalized here.
